# # IMPORTANT
# # This test exposes an important disadvantage of ndustria, 
# # which is that it relies on deterministic user functions. 
# # The three_second_function returns a random
# # number every time it executes, meaning that the function
# # does not return a unique result for a unique input.
# # This results in the saved cache files being unreliable as
# # each one will be overwritten with different values. 
# # Running with rerun=True will still work, but re-running 
# # from cache will not. 
# # 
# # This doesn't really affect this test since the whole point
# # is to test the timing functionality, but be warned that 
# # non-deterministic functions do not play nice with ndustria
